# Python Calculator
A calculator designed using Tkinter and Python to compute basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator works by prompting the user for input, validating it, performing the calculation using conditional statements, and displaying the result.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

In constructing a Python calculator with Tkinter, I initiated the project by importing Tkinter and creating a visually appealing window. The arrangement included an entry widget for input and results and the creation of digit and operator buttons. Aesthetic considerations led to a grid layout for the buttons. Running the Tkinter main loop brought the project to fruition, resulting in a polished and functional calculator.


## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time working with the Tkinker module. It allowed me to visualize how Python could be executed in a different way from the conventional terminal. I also achieved a deeper understanding of GUI design to make the application simple and intuitive.
